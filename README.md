A C# library to easily get data from Steam Web API.

## How can I use your project ?

**Warning:** API that needs **publisher key** (https://partner.steam-api.com) is not tollerant to errors. If you create too much errors (with a wrong key for example) your IP will be banned from Steam Web API. **DO NOT** call these APIs methods with standard steam web key. I am not responsible if you are banned from Steam Web API. See https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview for more details. That also means you **should not run every test** of the test project at once.
